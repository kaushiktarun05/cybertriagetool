InquestiQ: The intelligent Cyber triage tool for Digital Forensics

InquestiQ is an advanced AI-driven forensic triage tool designed to revolutionize digital investigations.

Key Features & Unique Points:
Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns and potential threats, providing a risk scoring system to prioritize findings effectively.
Seamlessly imports data from RAW forensic images and other formats, minimizing manual effort and speeding up the evidence collection process.
Offers interactive timelines and graphical summaries, enhancing the ability to quickly interpret and analyze large volumes of data.
Designed with both technical and non-technical users in mind, featuring an intuitive UI that simplifies complex forensic tasks without compromising on functionality.
Generates detailed reports in various formats (PDF, JSON, CSV), allowing for flexible documentation and sharing of findings.
Automates the scanning and analysis of system logs, network activity, files, and registry entries, ensuring a streamlined and efficient investigative process.

How it Addresses the Problem:

Investigators at FSL‚Äôs are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data in digital forensics. InquestiQ automates key processes, enabling real-time scanning, analysis, and prioritization of evidence. It allows investigators to focus on critical findings, dramatically shortening investigation timelines
